# BOILERPLATE ROLE HANDLERS
# ==============================================================================
#
# Handlers are special tasks that only run when triggered by other tasks.
# They are typically used for service restarts, reloads, or other actions
# that should only happen when configuration changes occur.
#
# Triggering handlers:
#   - Tasks use 'notify: handler_name' to trigger handlers
#   - Handlers only run if the notifying task reports 'changed' status
#   - All handlers run at the end of the play (after all tasks complete)
#   - Handlers run in the order they are defined, not notification order
#   - Each handler runs only once per play, even if notified multiple times
